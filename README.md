# Mi Cloud Download Script

1. Login to mi cloud https://i.mi.com
2. Navigate to https://us.i.mi.com/#record
3. In web browser (Chrome) press F12 to open Chrome developer tool
4. Navigate to Developer Console
6. Paste all the code and press Enter
7. Click `Ok/Allow` if browser asks for the permission
7. Wait until all the files are downloaded
